    "The first model should be built from scratch, i.e. create your own architecture and train the model\n",
    "If you perform various experiments or parameters tuning be sure to include everyting in the Notebook step by step with some brief comments about the experiments (e.g. effect of BatchNorm/layer sizes/optimizer on accuracy/train time/...)\n",

    "You can try any model you wish, e.g. ResNet, Inception, MobileNet, etc.\n",
